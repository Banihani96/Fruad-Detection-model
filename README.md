The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of effectively detecting fraudulent activities within a given dataset. 
This model aims to enhance the fraud detection process by leveraging predictive analytics and pattern recognition techniques inherent in machine learning algorithms.
Additionally, exploratory data analysis (EDA) has been conducted to gain insights into the characteristics and patterns of the data. EDA helps in understanding the distribution, relationships, and anomalies present within the dataset, 
thereby informing feature selection, preprocessing strategies, and model design for improved fraud detection performance. 
By integrating EDA findings with machine learning methodologies, the objective is to create a robust and accurate fraud detection system capable of identifying fraudulent transactions or activities with high precision and recall rates.
